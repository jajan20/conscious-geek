## First design decision
In his talk about why privacy matters Alessandro Acquisti shows us that even though a lot of people blindly accept the fact that they need to share their personal information and don't really think about what the consequences are. They shouldn't give up their right to privacy that easily. The argument is that I've got nothing to hide. But not having anything to hide doesn't mean personal information can't be sensitive information.

One of the examples that really stood out was where he presented a two photo's of the same woman but slightly altered. One picture didn't have a baby, the other did. He asked us if we would give the same job opportunities after seeing one picture and the other. His answer, no. The experiment resulted in people being biased, either consciously or unconsciously. This shows that even though you've got nothing to hide, other people can still treat you differently.

This is where I believe my dating app is different. Instead of judging someone on the way they look. You get the chance to review someone else's code. Now what users will do is read the code and decide whether or not they like the code conventions their potential match used. 

After someone likes your code back and you've been matched up you get to see a profile picture of your match. I still think it's important to know who you're talking to, so I hope by giving the option for a profile picture after you've been checking out their code it will result in a more meaningful, lasting relationship (as a partner, as a friend or as a rival.)

Biases still happen, that's something that happens naturally. But by using programming language as a base to work with. I think people sharing the same interests are less likely to judge how someone looks. But instead can support each other by giving feedback on code snippets.
